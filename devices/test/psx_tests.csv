# PSX Memory Controller register tests
# Format: test_name, op, offset, size, write_value, expected_read, description
#
# op: read, write, write_read (write then immediately read same register), reset
# offset: hex byte offset (register = offset >> 3)
# size: access size in bytes (1, 2, or 4)
# write_value: hex value to write (ignored for reads)
# expected_read: hex expected return from read (ignored for writes)
#
# Default state: sys_id=0x10000000, chip_rev=0, sys_config=PSX_BUS_SPEED_50(3)
# pages_cfg[5] = {0x88888888, ...}
# read() uses (offset >> 3) as register number
# write() uses (offset >> 3) as register number
